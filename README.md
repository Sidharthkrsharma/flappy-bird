CONCLUSION
the results of training an AI using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to play 
Flappy Bird. It highlights several key points about the training process and the effectiveness of 
NEAT as a technique for solving this simple game. Let's break down the main takeaways from the 
conclusion:
• Training Progress: The training process required approximately 8 generations to fully teach 
the AI how to play Flappy Bird. During the initial generations, the AI struggled and often 
hit the ground, but it showed improvement over time.
• Learning to Avoid Collisions: After about 5 or 6 generations, the AI started learning to 
avoid collisions, indicating a learning curve where the AI improved its ability to navigate 
through the game.
• Mastering the Game: By generation 8, the AI had fully learned how to avoid all the pipes in 
Flappy Bird, demonstrating that it had mastered the game's challenges. This highlights the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the NEAT algorithm in solving this particular problem.
• Small Population: It's worth noting that the population size used for training was small, yet 
NEAT was able to achieve success. This suggests that NEAT is capable of finding optimal 
solutions with limited computational resources.
• NEAT's Efficiency: NEAT is praised for its efficiency in finding simple and effective 
solutions. This is a fundamental characteristic of NEAT, as it evolves neural networks to 
optimize performance while keeping the network structures relatively simple.
• Potential for Future Applications: The conclusion suggests that the NEAT technique is not 
limited to Flappy Bird but can be applied to various games and scenarios in the future. The 
ability to find optimal solutions in a short number of generations makes NEAT a promising 
approach for other tasks and games.
Overall, the conclusion highlights the success of using NEAT to train an AI for playing 
Flappy Bird and underscores its efficiency and potential for broader applications. It's 
important to note that the effectiveness of NEAT can vary depending on the complexity of 
the problem, and it may require more generations and a larger population for more 
challenging tasks
